I want you to perform a complete audit of my current web project and provide a detailed report.

1️⃣ FRONTEND ANALYSIS
- List all pages, forms, fields, and UI components.
- Indicate which fields are required, optional, and sensitive (like SSN, documents, income).
- Show any frontend logic implemented (validations, auto-save, autocomplete, dynamic behaviors).
- Identify any missing or incomplete UX features according to modern best practices.

2️⃣ BACKEND / DATABASE ANALYSIS
- List all tables, columns, and relationships (including foreign keys and sensitive data handling).
- Explain how each table is used in the project (e.g., applications, users, co-applicants, documents).
- Indicate which tables store encrypted or sensitive data.
- Describe any backend logic implemented (e.g., serverless functions, email notifications, payment handling, application ID generation).

3️⃣ AUTHENTICATION & ROLES
- Describe how applicant and admin authentication is implemented.
- List role permissions and what each role can do on the frontend and backend.
- Indicate any missing authentication features (e.g., forgot password, email verification).

4️⃣ EMAIL & NOTIFICATIONS
- List all automated emails or notifications implemented (SendGrid or other).
- Indicate triggers, recipients, and content of each email.
- Note any missing email flows.

5️⃣ FILE STORAGE & UPLOADS
- Describe how uploaded files are handled (storage path, file type, size limits).
- Explain access permissions and security measures (signed URLs, private access).

6️⃣ DASHBOARDS & UI WORKFLOW
- Explain applicant and admin dashboard functionality.
- Show how application statuses, payment status, and documents are displayed and updated.
- Identify any missing features for workflow completion.

7️⃣ SECURITY & BEST PRACTICES
- Point out how sensitive data is encrypted or handled securely.
- Highlight any potential security or privacy issues.

8️⃣ REMAINING WORK
- Based on the current project, give a list of features and steps required to complete the project fully.
- Include both frontend and backend tasks.
- Suggest improvements or optimizations for UX, security, or performance.

⚠️ Output everything clearly in structured sections, so I can use this as a master reference to complete the project. Make sure your analysis is accurate to the current state of the codebase.

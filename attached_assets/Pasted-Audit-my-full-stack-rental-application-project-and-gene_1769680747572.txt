Audit my full-stack rental application project and generate a detailed completion plan. 

1️⃣ Analyze the **frontend**:
   - List all implemented features (forms, dashboards, validation, auto-save, file uploads, multilingual support, etc.)
   - Identify any missing UX, validation, or real-time behaviors.

2️⃣ Analyze the **Supabase backend**:
   - Check all tables, columns, and relationships (applications, applicant info, co-applicants, occupancy, employment, financial info, references, signatures, documents, payments, status history).
   - List which tables and columns are missing or need modifications.
   - Identify missing RLS policies, authentication flows, and row-level security checks.
   - Note what needs to be done for file storage buckets and permissions.

3️⃣ Analyze **Edge Functions**:
   - List which functions exist, which are placeholders, and which need deployment (e.g., send-email, recover-id).
   - Identify missing email flows, triggers, and secret configurations (e.g., SendGrid API).

4️⃣ Analyze **dashboards**:
   - Applicant dashboard: confirm which features are implemented (status tracking, uploaded documents, application ID, payment info, bilingual display).
   - Admin dashboard: confirm features (view all applications, mark payments, update statuses, view uploaded documents, statistics).

5️⃣ Identify **missing features for production readiness**:
   - Payment handling (manual vs automated)
   - Security gaps (admin authentication, session handling)
   - Bilingual email and UI coverage
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - Any leftover Python or non-Supabase logic that needs removal
   - Hosting considerations (Netlify, serverless functions, or Supabase hosting)

6️⃣ Output:
   - A complete checklist of remaining tasks with prioritization (high, medium, low)
   - Notes about any potential blockers if we continue on mobile only
   - Suggestions for next steps to make the project fully functional and production ready

Focus on **Supabase + frontend** workflow. Do not attempt automatic deployment or refactoring—only audit and list what’s remaining.

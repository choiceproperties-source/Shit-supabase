🎯 OBJECTIVE

Improve the rental application form by implementing the following selected enhancements only, in a safe, legally appropriate, and technically reasonable way.

Do not introduce unapproved features, claims, or integrations.

⸻

1️⃣ TRUST & CREDIBILITY (UI ONLY – NO FALSE CLAIMS)

Implement visual trust indicators using generic language only:
	•	Display a secure connection indicator (lock icon + tooltip)
	•	Add professional trust text such as:
	•	“Applications are processed securely using industry-standard practices.”
	•	Example: “Background checks may use industry-standard providers such as TransUnion or Experian where permitted.”

⸻

2️⃣ PERFORMANCE & RELIABILITY
	•	localStorage caching: Persist non-sensitive form data for recovery and faster return visits.
	•	Offline-safe persistence: Ensure data is not lost if the connection drops.
	•	Client-side image optimization: Compress uploaded images before upload.

⚠️ CRITICAL:
	•	Do NOT persist sensitive data (SSN, government ID, banking info) in localStorage.
	•	Sensitive fields may exist only in memory during active session.

⸻

3️⃣ SMART FORM BEHAVIOR & UX

Enhance form behavior with:
	•	Real-time validation: Show helpful, human-readable feedback (not just errors).
	•	Context-sensitive help: Tooltips explaining why sensitive info is required.
	•	Session recovery: Restore progress after refresh or crash using safe backups.

⸻

4️⃣ ERROR PREVENTION & DATA QUALITY

Implement intelligent safeguards:
	•	Auto-format:
	•	Phone numbers
	•	Dates
	•	SSN (masked input)
	•	Prevent impossible values:
	•	Move-in dates in the past
	•	Illogical date sequences
	•	Consistency checks: Warn if rent vs income appears unrealistic.
	•	Duplicate detection: Soft warning if email/phone matches an existing application.

⚠️ Duplicate detection must be informational only, not blocking.

⸻

5️⃣ LANGUAGE SUPPORT (LIMITED SCOPE)
	•	Provide UI language toggle:
	•	English
	•	Spanish
	•	Translate:
	•	Labels
	•	Help text
	•	Instructions

⚠️ DO NOT translate:
	•	Legal disclosures
	•	Authorization language
	•	Compliance text

⸻

6️⃣ DATA PRIVACY & SECURITY TRANSPARENCY (UI LEVEL)

Implement:
	•	Encryption indicator during submission (simple lock icon + message)
	

❌ Do NOT claim audits, certifications, or regulatory approval.

⸻

7️⃣ POST-SUBMISSION EXPERIENCE

After successful submission:
	•	Send confirmation email via SendGrid
	•	Display a Next Steps timeline (e.g., review window, follow-up expectations)
	•	Provide access to a status dashboard (read-only for applicant)

Optional but allowed:
	•	In-app status notifications
	•	SMS is NOT required at this stage

⸻

8️⃣ SAVE & RESUME

Implement:
	•	Secure, token-based “Save & Resume” link
	•	Time-limited access
	•	Ability to continue on another device

⸻

🚫 EXPLICIT NON-GOALS (DO NOT IMPLEMENT)
	•	PDF generation
	•	SMS integration
	•	Claims of third-party audits
	•	AI document verification
	•	Credit decision automation

If any feature appears ambiguous, pause and ask before proceeding.

⸻

✅ DELIVERY EXPECTATIONS
	•	Improve UX while preserving existing data structures
	•	Do not modify legal language
	•	Do not invent compliance claims
	•	Keep implementation modular and phase-ready
	•	Comment code clearly where sensitive data handling is involved

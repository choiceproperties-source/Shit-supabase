PROJECT CONTEXT:
We have a rental application website. The frontend is in HTML/CSS/JS and the backend uses Supabase. Applications are stored in the "rental_applications" table with fields:
- id (uuid)
- application_id (text)
- property_address (text)
- applicant_name (text)
- applicant_email (text)
- form_data (jsonb)
- created_at (timestamp)

STATUS LOGIC:
- application_status: "awaiting_payment", "under_review", "approved", "denied"
- payment_status: "pending", "paid"

TASK:
Generate a fully functional Applicant Dashboard using the existing frontend framework (HTML/CSS/JS) that satisfies the following:

FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS:
1. Show all applications for the currently logged-in applicant (filter by email/session).
2. Display per application:
   - Application ID
   - Property Address
   - Submission Date
   - Payment Status (🟡 Pending, ✅ Paid)
   - Application Status (Awaiting Payment, Under Review, Approved, Denied)
3. Show next steps/messages dynamically based on status:
   - Awaiting Payment: instructions to pay outside the system
   - Under Review: review timeline and next steps
   - Approved: approval message and next steps
   - Denied: denial message and respectful disclaimer
4. Real-time updates when application_status or payment_status changes.
5. Show uploaded documents (list) and allow download via secure signed URLs.

BACKEND / SUPABASE LOGIC:
1. Fetch applications filtered by applicant_email securely.
2. Use Supabase Realtime or subscriptions to auto-update dashboard when admin changes status or confirms payment.
3. Ensure sensitive data (SSN) is masked or not shown.

UX REQUIREMENTS:
1. Status badges with clear colors/icons:
   - 🟡 Pending Payment
   - 🔍 Under Review
   - ✅ Approved
   - ❌ Denied
2. Clear next step instructions per status.
3. Dashboard should be mobile-friendly.

SECURITY:
1. Only the logged-in applicant can see their own applications.
2. Supabase keys must remain secure, not exposed in frontend code.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Provide exact files (HTML, CSS, JS) or code snippets.
- Include instructions where to paste each file in the project structure.
- Ensure the code integrates with the existing form and database structure.
- No assumptions about changing backend tech (Supabase remains).
- No payment processor integration; continue using manual payment logic.

Please provide complete, ready-to-use code for this Applicant Dashboard.

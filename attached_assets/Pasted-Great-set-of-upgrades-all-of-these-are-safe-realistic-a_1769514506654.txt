Great set of upgrades — all of these are safe, realistic, and won’t over-complicate your build 👍
The key now is how you instruct the AI so it updates the project surgically, not chaotically.

Below is a clean, copy-paste–ready Replit AI prompt that tells it exactly what to change, what not to touch, and how to implement each item correctly.

⸻

✅ REPLIT AI UPDATE PROMPT (SAFE & CONTROLLED)

ROLE:
You are updating an existing rental application project built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
The project structure is already separated into HTML, CSS, and JS files and is currently working.

IMPORTANT RULES:
	•	Do NOT redesign the UI
	•	Do NOT remove or rename existing fields unless instructed
	•	Do NOT change submission flow or backend logic
	•	Do NOT break existing validation or navigation
	•	Only implement the updates listed below
	•	Keep all changes minimal and additive

⸻

🎯 REQUIRED UPDATES (IMPLEMENT ALL)

1️⃣ APPLICATION FEE (FIXED)
	•	Set the application fee as a fixed $50
	•	Display it clearly in the Review / Submit section
	•	Add a clarity note below it:

“Application fee is a non-refundable $50 and is required before your application can be reviewed.”

	•	Do NOT make the fee editable
	•	Do NOT integrate payment processing

⸻

2️⃣ ADDRESS AUTOCOMPLETE (GEOAPIFY)
	•	Implement address autocomplete using Geoapify API
	•	Use this API key:

bea2afb13c904abea5cb2c2693541dcf

	•	Enable autocomplete for:
	•	Property address
	•	Current residence address
	•	Addresses should autocomplete as the user types
	•	When an address is selected:
	•	Auto-fill street, city, state, and ZIP where applicable
	•	Do not break manual typing if autocomplete fails

⸻

3️⃣ AUTO-SAVE (NON-DISTRACTING)
	•	Implement automatic form saving:
	•	Save progress on input change (debounced)
	•	Store non-sensitive fields only
	•	Display a subtle save indicator, not alerts:
	•	Example (small text near header or footer):

“Progress saved”

	•	The message should:
	•	Appear briefly
	•	Fade out automatically
	•	Never interrupt the user

⸻

4️⃣ LEASE TERM OPTIONS

Update the lease term field to include:
	•	6 Months
	•	12 Months
	•	18 Months
	•	24 Months
	•	Month-to-Month (if already allowed)

Ensure:
	•	Dropdown behavior stays the same
	•	Existing selection logic is preserved

⸻

5️⃣ REAL-TIME INPUT FORMATTING & VALIDATION

Add automatic formatting while the user types for:
	•	Phone numbers → (XXX) XXX-XXXX
	•	SSN → XXX-XX-XXXX (masked input)
	•	Dates → browser native date input or validated format

Rules:
	•	Formatting should be automatic
	•	Validation should be inline and friendly
	•	Do NOT show red errors while typing
	•	Block submission only if invalid at submit time

⸻

6️⃣ SSN FIELD UX (OPTIONAL, TRUST-FOCUSED)

Next to the SSN field (small, subtle text):

🔒 Encrypted during transmission and stored securely

Label:

Social Security Number (Optional)

Helper text below field:

Providing your SSN may help speed up identity and background verification when required by the property manager.

Additional note (small, muted text):

SSN is encrypted and only accessible to authorized reviewers.
We do not share this information without legal or screening requirements.

Rules:
	•	SSN must remain optional
	•	Keep masked input
	•	Do NOT store SSN in localStorage

⸻

7️⃣ CLEAR FORM / RESET FEATURE

Add a “Clear Application” or “Start Over” option that:
	•	Clears all entered form data
	•	Resets UI to initial state
	•	Clears saved progress (localStorage/session)
	•	Asks for confirmation before clearing

Example confirmation text:

“This will clear all entered information. Are you sure you want to start over?”

⸻

8️⃣ REFERENCES REQUIREMENT UPDATE
	•	First reference → Required
	•	Second reference → Optional
	•	Update validation rules accordingly
	•	Do not remove second reference fields

⸻

🛑 DO NOT DO THE FOLLOWING
	•	Do NOT introduce new pages
	•	Do NOT change backend integration
	•	Do NOT add payment gateways
	•	Do NOT alter submission status logic
	•	Do NOT rename database fields

⸻

✅ FINAL CHECK

After implementing:
	•	Verify the form still submits correctly
	•	Verify no console errors
	•	Verify autocomplete works smoothly
	•	Verify auto-save does not store sensitive data
	•	Verify UI looks the same except for added clarity

If any requirement is unclear, pause and ask before making assumptions.

🧠 WHY THIS PROMPT WORKS

✔ Keeps AI focused
✔ Prevents overengineering
✔ Protects your UX and flow
✔ Avoids breaking backend plans
✔ Implements only what you approved

If you want next:
	•	A validation checklist
	•	A test plan for each feature
	•	Or a Supabase-ready migration prompt

Just say the word.
